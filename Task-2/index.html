      <p>
        Severus Snape was born 9 January, 1960 to Tobias Snape, an abusive Muggle, and Eileen Prince, a
        neglectful pure-blood witch. He began to identify with his mother's family and created a secret nickname
        from his mother's maiden name, calling himself the "Half-Blood Prince". His unhappy relationship with
        his father may have been the origin of his disdain for Muggles. It is implied that Severus was
        friendless and uncared for by his parents. This lack of care largely shaped Severus's bitter disposition
        and cruel behaviourSeverus had a passion for the Dark Arts from a young age, and was especially talented
        with curses, or so some believed.Severus attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a
        student from 1971-1978 and was Sorted into Slytherin House, at that time led by Potions master Horace
        Slughorn. On the way to Hogwarts for his first year, Severus sat with Lily Evans on the train. While on
        the train they met James Potter and Sirius Black. This encounter between the three of them revolved
        around a disagreement regarding what Hogwarts house was the best. This hostile first encounter would set
        the tone for the antagonism between the three of them for the rest of his life.

        Severus was extremely adept in the art of potion-making and worked as the Potions Master at
        Hogwarts for about fifteen years. His prowess at potion-making extended beyond simple execution from
        formally documented recipes accepted and followed by the general public. Severus had a passion for the
        Dark Arts from a young age, and was especially talented with curses, or so some believed. According to
        Sirius Black, Snape was "up to his eyeballs in the Dark Arts" when he was at school. However, they had
        an age-old rivalry which could have influenced Sirius's words. When he was still a student, Snape was
        already talented enough that he was capable of creating new dark spells, as most of the spells he
        created were curses, hexes, and jinxes

        Later in the evening, Snape was summoned by Voldemort to the Shrieking Shack. Voldemort explained that
        he believed that Snape was the master of the Elder Wand from killing Dumbledore and that Snape must die
        so that the Elder Wand can be his. Snape tried to explain the situation but Voldemort ordered Nagini to
        kill Snape by biting into his neck, injecting him with her extremely poisonous venom, before he could
        finish speaking. Before dying, Snape released a cloud of memories and told Harry, who had watched the
        entire scene from a hidden spot, to take them.
